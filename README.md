# connectfour
This connect four game was completed as part of the Springboard.com software engineering curriculum.
As an exercise, we were provided with some starter code that we needed to completed in order to make the game functional.
The gameboard is constructed using javascript (as opposed to html).  Gameplay involves dropping tokens from the top of the gameboard into a cell below.
When a player connects 4 game pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that player is declared the winner.
