# connectfour
This connect four game was completed as part of the Springboard.com software engineering curriculum.
As an exercise, I was provided with some starter code that I needed to complete in order to make the game functional.
The gameboard and functionality is constructed using javascript.  Gameplay involves dropping tokens from the top of the gameboard into a cell below.  
When a player connects 4 game pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that player is declared the winner.
